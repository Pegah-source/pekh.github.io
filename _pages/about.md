I am currently in my fourth year at Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau) and also in my third year at Ecole Télécom Paris. At the moment, I am working as a research intern at valeo.ai.

Previously, I did an internship at Vita Lab (EPFL), studying pose estimation methods for detecting keypoints in clothing items.

My main area of interest revolves around computer vision, especially its applications in learning methods for planning and forecasting trajectories in autonomous driving.
