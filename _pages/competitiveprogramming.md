This is an attempt to start re-learning and improve my coding skills when it comes to competitive programing. I never really made a huge effort to progress continuously, but still participated in a competition and had a related course here and there.

Long story short, this would be more of a blog for myself (which serves also as a mean to keep committing to learning), and the goal is not to document stuff in a clean way (just ignore/don't read the blog is what I'm saying, haha).
